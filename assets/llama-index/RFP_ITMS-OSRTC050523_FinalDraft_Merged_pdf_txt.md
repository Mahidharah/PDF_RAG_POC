          shall be computed as follows: (a) where any intermediary is controlled by a person through
          management control or otherwise, the entire shareholding held by such controlled
          intermediary in any other person (the “Subject Person”) shall be taken into account for
          computing the shareholding of such controlling person in the Subject Person; and (b) subject

                                                                                                               9

4. Functional Requirements
4.1. Automated Fare Collection System
4.1.1. ETIM Ticketing
After implementation of project, the tickets will be issued to passengers through Electronic Ticket
Issuing Machines (ETIM) inside the bus or at the booking counter. It will be done on a real-time basis
through the GPRS-enabled EMV based ETIMs, as opposed to the current situation wherein manual
printed tickets are issued to passengers and reconciliation done at the end of the journey or end of
the day at depot.
Bidder shall have to design, develop, install and maintain centralised ticketing system as per
standard specification mentioned for Common mobility cards.
Bidder shall have to procure, install and maintain EMV based ETIMs and its related accessories.
ETIM shall be EMV certified GPRS machine and will have capability to send ticketing data without
data loss to the central system. These ETIM machines shall have capability read and validate EMV
OSRTC Transit Cards (OTCs).
During travel in a bus, the passenger specifies the destination of travel to the conductor who then
uses the ETIM machine to punch in the necessary details (destination code, passenger category,
no. of tickets, etc.) and generate the e-ticket using the thermal printer. The conductor collects the fare
in case the commuter wishes to pay in cash.

                                                                                                                 Page 21 of 120

Passengers with OTCs will show their card to the conductor for cashless payment of fare. Conductor
will tap the contactless card on the ETIM machine, which will validate the card and deduct the fare
amount for the route from the card. The final amount will be written back on the card by the ETIM
machine.
The centralised ticketing system shall further send the transaction data to the Acquirer Bank.
Clearing House settles the payment balances between the Issuing and Acquirer Banks/FI daily (in
case of an Open Loop card implementation).
Provide EMV as well as PCI-DSS compliant hardware for acquiring related applications as per OTC
specifications.
Provide NCMC Certified payment application for collection and settlement of fare against cash and
OTCs.
This change enables the OSRTC to conduct an ongoing assessment of ticket sales, seat availability,
as well as keeping tabs on pilferage on the bus when it is on the move. Data can also be
synchronised on Wi-Fi if there is data loss on GPRS, when conductor reaches the depot.
The figure shows below describes the to-be process flow for ticketing process inside bus or at booking
counter.

4.13. Business Intelligence Platform
BI Dashboard is a modern concept that aims to leverage several modern technologies to aid dynamic
MIS report and updates of ITMS, OSRTC would like to be able to get better and dynamic MIS reports
and updates of each department and helps to get better and fast decision. OSRTC would like to get
quality of response within minimal time. BI framework provides a support mechanism for better and
dynamic updates with limited resources and thus reduces costs.
As part of the BI Dashboard infrastructure, it provides centralized BI Dashboards for key dignitaries
such as commissioner and head of the departments through a Control Centre. The BI Dashboard
would enable viewing maps and images of any region and allow fusing of various data thus,
becoming a part of information-assimilation process in format displays for key dignitaries in
governance. It would be appropriate to adopt these dashboards for high-level reviews/meets etc.
Customized Dashboard allows status monitoring and reviews on the Dashboard view. The
Dashboard helps government authorities with inbuilt features like viewing various abstract- scenarios
and situational awareness and display like Project Status, revenue, and many other data. The BI
Dashboard serves maps, tables, text, and applications from the BI Framework. Key datasets will be
used to show graphical views of statistics. Information can be displayed in tables, charts, and
thematic maps.
  The proposed solution will be based on 3-tier architecture, web enabled with the data stored
     centrally/ distributed on server(s).
  The application will be independent of Operating System, Browser, and the database.
  The application will be open, inter-operable, highly scalable, and capable of delivering high-
     performance in varied field conditions.
  Component-based architecture to enable extensibility of features and functions.
  Framework choice is based on various factors including scalability, easy to upgrade etc.
  Common-logging and log4j will be used for logging purposes in the applications.

               The purpose of Pervasive Business Intelligence Layer is to augment the native BI
               capabilities      of    applications       hosted on the data center.             Almost every business
               application hosted on the data center will have set of reports to be used by the business
               users. It is expected that the level of maturity of reporting and analytics would vary
    1.1        across applications. Data centers will provide a pervasive business intelligence layer,
               which can get linked to disparate repositories and can extend the analytics capabilities
               of hosted applications. This will ensure a single view of business performance matrix
               (e.g., Cost view, revenue view, project status view etc.) is given to the business users
               to help them make better decisions.

       the business metadata layer dimensionally or relationally

 1.28  Facility to define visually: Dimensions, Levels of hierarchy, Measures, categorization

 1.29  Solution shall automatically detect and suggest hierarchical structures in data sets

 1.30  Solution shall automatically verify the integrity of data elements that being considered
       for modeling
 1.31  Map physical data structures to business terms in an easy-to-use interface

 1.32  Define consistent business views of the data for relational tables and OLAP cubes

 1.33  Single meta data layer should be used by all the various BI features

       The same modeling Solution should model the business metadata layer from both a
 1.34  warehouse that is in a star-schema as well as the transactional system relational tables
       that are not in a star-schema.

       Multiple metadata views should be able to be developed and published to users. For
 1.35  example, a single metadata model/file should create multiple ‘views’ of the metadata
       for end user consumption

       Solution should dynamically make suggestions/recommendations of how the metadata
 1.36  should be best designed. For example, the Solution should check the defined join paths
       to ensure there are no issues such as looped joins.

 1.37  The metadata Solution should include version control capabilities
 1.38  Should be able to connect to most of the OLAP cubes like SQL, MS-SQL, DB2, Oracle,
       Hyperion

       The drill path should be based on business hierarchies that are not necessarily
       organized in the same manner as in the physical representation in the database. By
 1.39  default, when users drill down, the system must automatically drill to the next
       dimension/level in the business hierarchy. However, users may also select a different
       drill path to other hierarchies during analysis.

 1.40  Alternate drill down paths should be supported. These should be created at the
       metadata modeling Solution.

                                                                                                 Page 62 of 120

Various layers of the HRMS application architecture are described as below:
           i.          Client: HRMS Application for OSRTC should be browser-based application and should run
                       on all major web browsers (such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.).
                       Web browsers should be compatible with any mobile device including Android, iOS, etc.
         ii.           Presentation Layer: Presentation Layer should enforce uniform header, footer and
                       standard side bar items and navigation in each screen to maintain uniform look and feel of
                       the data. The interface of the HRMS application should be user-friendly and easy to operate
                       as the users shall also include Category-IV employees.
        iii.           Business Layer: Business Layer should implement the process flow and logic that drives
                       the business functionality. Inter-operable and Open Standard/protocols like web enabled
                       services, APIs. This layer should also give functionality for data exchange using web-
                       enabled services-based component or database synchronization with external agency. The
                       framework should have provision to keeps all the user activity to be audited and logged
                       during the business process.
        iv.            Database Layer: It has been visualized that the HRMS solution for this project would have
                       to manage very high volumes of data and would have to store a large amount of data for
                       long-term preservation of records at various repositories. It is mandatory for the System
                       Integrator to ensure faster access and better manageability of this data. The System
                       Integrator should propose technology that is powerful enough for designing and querying
                       database models at the conceptual level, where the application is described in terms easily
                       understood by non-technical users. The System Integrator is expected to use data models
                       that can capture more business rules and are easy to validate and evolve. It is expected
                       that the System Integrator shall consider mechanisms that would improve the performance
                       of this layer.

7. Service Level Agreement (SLAs)
The primary intent of Penalties is to ensure that the system performs in accordance with the defined
service levels. Penalties are not meant to be punitive or, conversely, a vehicle for additional fees.
This section describes the service levels to be established for the Services offered by the Bidder to
OSRTC. The Bidder shall monitor and maintain the stated service levels to provide quality service
to OSRTC.

          o    Handholding Support: Application Support Service Levels
          o    Help Desk Service Levels

7.1. Definitions
  “Scheduled Maintenance Time” shall mean the time that the System is not in service due to a
     scheduled activity as defined in this SLA. The scheduled maintenance time would not be
     during 18x7 timeframe. Further, scheduled maintenance time is planned downtime with the
     prior permission of OSRTC.
  18x7 shall mean hours between 5AM – 11 PM on all working days excluding Public Holidays or
     any other Holidays observed by OSRTC.
  “Scheduled operation time” means the scheduled operating hours of the System for the
     month.       All scheduled maintenance time on the system would be deducted from the total
     operation time for the month to give the scheduled operation time. The total operation time for
     the systems and applications within the Primary DC, DRC will be 24x7x365. The total operation
     time for the client site systems shall be the business hours of OSRTC.
  “System or Application downtime” means accumulated time during which the System is totally
     inoperable within the Scheduled Operation Time but outside the scheduled maintenance time
     and measured from the time OSRTC and/or its employees log a call with the Bidder team of
     the failure or the failure is known to the Bidder from the availability measurement tools to the time
     when the System is returned to proper operation.
  “Availability” means the time for which the services and facilities are available for conducting
     operations on the OSRTC system including application and associated infrastructure. Availability
     is defined as:
  {(Scheduled Operation Time – System Downtime) / (Scheduled Operation Time)} * 100%
  “Helpdesk Support” shall mean the 22x7 basis support center which shall handle Fault reporting,
     Trouble Ticketing and related enquiries during this contract. Helpdesk support is to be provided
     from 4:00 AM to 2.00 AM (all working days)
  “Incident” refers to any event / abnormalities in the functioning of the any of IT Equipment /
     Services that may lead to disruption in normal operations of the Data Centre, System or
     Application services.
  The business hours are 4:00 AM to 2.00 AM on all working days. The Bidder however recognizes
     the fact that OSRTC offices will require us to work beyond the business hours on need basis.
  "Non-Business Hours" shall mean hours excluding “Business Hours”.

7.2. Commencement and Duration of SLA
This SLA shall commence on the date of signing of Agreement or issue of Work Order by OSRTC
and the Bidder (hereinafter the ‘effective date’) whichever is earlier and shall, unless terminated
earlier in accordance with its terms or unless otherwise agreed by the parties, continue for a period
of 3 years (extendable up to 2 years) after “Go-live” of the Project.

7.3. Interpretation & General Instructions
  "Non-Business Hours" shall mean hours excluding “Business Hours”.
  Bidder shall provide an automated tool to monitor and report all the SLAs as mentioned.

                                                                                                            Page 103 of 120
---
                              RFP Volume-2: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS

  A Service Level violation will occur if the Bidder fails to meet Minimum Service Levels, as
     measured on a Quarterly basis, for a particular Service Level. Overall Availability and
     Performance Measurements will be monthly for the purpose of Service Level reporting. An
     “Availability and Performance Report” will be provided by the Bidder on monthly basis in the
     OSRTC suggested format and a review shall be conducted based on this report. A monthly
     Availability and Performance Report shall be provided to the OSRTC at the end of every month
     containing the summary of all incidents reported and associated Bidder performance
     measurement for that period.
  The SLAs will prevail from the start of the Operations and Maintenance Phase. Payments to the
     Bidder are linked to the compliance with the SLA metrics laid down in the tables below. The
     penalties will be computed and calculated as per the computation explained in this Section.
     During the contract period, it is envisaged that there could be changes to the SLA in terms of
     addition, alteration or deletion of certain parameters, based on mutual consent of both the parties
     i.e., OSRTC and Bidder.
  The SLA is not a fixed document to be produced once and used forever. Instead, it must be re-
     evaluated and updated as the work environment changes. As technology changes, the services
     and systems covered by the SLA and their performance expectations will change. This document
     may be reviewed and revised by mutual Agreement between OSRTC and Bidder. Changes to
     the SLA may be required at other times to include new systems, changes in operating hours, etc.
  All changes to the SLA will be initiated in writing between OSRTC and the Bidder. The Service
     levels here are standard for OSRTC and will be modified when both parties agree to an appended
     set of terms and conditions.
  All measurements and calculations shall be in the metric system and calculations done to 2 (two)
     decimal places, with the third digit of 5 (five) or above being rounded up and below 5 (five) being
     rounded down except in money calculations where such amounts shall be rounded off to the
     nearest Rupee.
  The following table outlines the key service level requirements for the system, which need be
     ensured by the Bidder during the operations and maintenance period. These requirements shall
     be strictly imposed and either OSRTC or a third-party audit/certification agency shall be deployed
     for certifying the performance of the Bidder against the target performance metrics as outlined in
     the tables below.

7.4. Implementation Service Level
  Parameters: The SLA parameters for the implementation stage would be directly related to the
     delivery timelines of the deliverables as mentioned. This would consist of the entire Bill of
     Materials and the applications system with successful UAT of the same.
  Period: These SLAs would be applicable until GO-LIVE. The deliverables would be measured at
     every payment milestone as mentioned.
  Penalty Value: For delay of every week in completion & submission of the deliverable, the SI
     would be charged with a penalty as follows.
       Delay (Weeks)                     Penalty % on the respective Payment milestone value
                1                                                        0.15 %
                2                                                        0.20 %
                3                                                        0.25 %

                                                                                                          Page 104 of 120
---
                               RFP Volume-2: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS

  Capping: The upper limit of penalty would be capped at 10% of the respective Payment Milestone
     value. In case the successful bidder reaches 10% of the respective Payment Milestone value in
     the form of penalty at any point of time during pre-implementation phase, OSRTC reserves the
     right to invoke the termination clause.
  A delay of every week would also account for an increase of an additional 2 weeks in the
     maintenance period which will be over and above the maintenance period of 3+2 years. This
     duration would be accounted without incurring any charges to OSRTC.

7.5. Operation Service Level
SLA Management and Monitoring Tool as specified in this RFP shall play a critical role in monitoring
the SLA compliance and hence will have to be customized accordingly. The 3rd party testing and
audit of the system shall put sufficient emphasis on ensuring the capability of SLA Management and
Monitoring Tool to capture SLA compliance correctly and as specified in this RFP. The selected
Bidder (SI) must deploy SLA Management and Monitoring tool and provide for capturing the required
data for SLA report generation in automated way. This tool should generate the SLA Management
and Monitoring report at the end of every month and every quarter which is to be shared with OSRTC.
OSRTC will audit the tool and the scripts on a regular basis.
Where required, some of the Service Levels will be assessed through audits or reports e.g.,
utilization reports, measurements report, etc., as appropriate to be provided by the Bidder on a
quarterly basis, in the formats as required by OSRTC.

It may be noted that the Bidder must provide the required tools to measure the SLA parameters.
OSRTC reserves the right to appoint a Third Party for the audits. Audits will normally be done on a
regular basis or as required by OSRTC and will be performed by OSRTC or OSRTC appointed third
party agencies. The bidder shall make provision that requisite permission is given to the Third-Party
Agency for carrying out the audit process on regular basis.

7.6. Violations and Associated Penalties
The framework for Penalties, because of not meeting the Service Level Agreements Targets is as
follows:
  A quarterly performance evaluation will be conducted using the Quarterly reporting periods of
     that period.
  The performance will be measured for each of the defined service level metric against the
     minimum/ target service level requirements and the violations will be calculated accordingly.
  The number of violations in the reporting period for each level of severity will be totaled and used
     for the calculation of Penalties.

    respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder.
  Penalties applicable for each of the low severity (L) violations are Quarter percentage (0.25%)
    of respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder.
  Penalties applicable for not meeting a high (H) severity performance target in two consecutive
    Quarters on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 3% of the respective Quarterly
    payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each such high critical
    activity.
  Penalties applicable for not meeting a medium (M) severity performance target in two
    consecutive Quarterly periods on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 2% of the
    respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each
    such medium critical activity.
  Penalties applicable for not meeting a low (L) severity performance target in two consecutive
    Quarterly periods on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 1% of the respective
    Quarterly payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each such medium
    critical activity.
  It is to be noted that if the overall penalty applicable for any of the review period during the
    contract exceeds 25% of the quarterly payment or if the overall penalty applicable for any of the
    successive Quarterly periods during the contract is above 15%; then OSRTC shall have the right
    to encash the Performance Bank Guarantee or terminate the contract or both.

                The Bidder is expected to submit a quarterly report on the availability to OSRTC.
                Client Site Infrastructure Systems.
                Critical Client Site Systems: The failure or disruption results in inability of the user unit to service
                   its dependent user units or perform critical OSRTC’s functions. Critical client site infrastructure
                   means the IT infrastructure at client site which are shared by multiple users i.e., Core Switch,
                   Core Routers or anything from end user to application access etc.
                The below tables give details on the Service Levels the Bidder should maintain.
                Bidder shall ensure that no non-production activity (issue resolution, bug fixing, UAT, Testing,
                   patch update) is carried out on Production (Live) ITS server. All such activities shall be carried
                   out on a separate Test/ Non-production server by the Bidder. In case of non-compliance, OSRTC
                   reserves the right to impose penalty, 5% of the subsequent payment, during the period of
                   operation and may also invoke the Termination Clause

13.       Acceptance of Deliverables and Testing
13.1. Acceptance of deliverables
The successful completion of the Project requires the acceptance by OSRTC of all deliverables
prepared and delivered pursuant to the Project. Upon completion of a Deliverable, SI will notify
OSRTC in writing that the deliverables have been completed and in the case of deliverables
constituted of software, hardware, and networking (“Operational Deliverables”), tested and/or
certified as being ready for acceptance (“Ready for Acceptance”) by OSRTC. Promptly after receiving
such notice, OSRTC will evaluate the deliverable for acceptance in accordance with specific
provisions provided in the RFP. The acceptance process outlined below shall not be deemed to
extend the Timelines / scheduled completion date for any deliverable specified in the RFP.

13.2. Acceptance Procedure
Acceptance by OSRTC (“Acceptance”) requires that the Deliverables be confirmed in writing by
OSRTC to meet applicable acceptance criteria (“Acceptance Criteria”) which, in the case of

                                                                                                         Page 17 of 49

                               RFP Volume-3: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS

Operational Deliverables, will include the successful completion of agreed acceptance and
performance testing and, in the case of the System as a whole, will include meeting the
specifications, performance standards and functional requirements set out in the RFP. In the case
of Deliverables that are component parts of the System, in addition to acceptance of the component
deliverables, the system will also be subject to acceptance in its entirety. SI shall prepare and
propose the test procedures, which shall be described in the acceptance criteria for each deliverable
and shall be subject to agreement by OSRTC. While designing the acceptance test procedures the
requirements as mentioned in volume II of RFP need to be adhered. The Acceptance tests and test
procedures shall be sufficiently broad in scope and rigorous to verify that the system and all other
deliverables meet all applicable specifications, acceptance criteria and performance requirements,
including assurance that the deliverables and the system meet such tests of operational integrity as
may be reasonably required by OSRTC. In the case of the system, the acceptance tests shall consist
of unit tests, a system test, and/or stress test acceptance procedures for written deliverables (which
are all deliverables other than Operational Deliverables) and Operational Deliverables are as follows:

Written Deliverables
The SI may submit interim drafts of written deliverables (e.g., system designs and documentation)
to OSRTC for review. OSRTC agrees to review each interim draft within a reasonable period after
receiving it from the SI. When the SI delivers a final written deliverable to OSRTC, OSRTC will have
the opportunity to review such written deliverable for an acceptance period of seven (7) days or such
other period as is stated in the RFP or the agreed Project Plan (the “Acceptance Period”). In all
cases, OSRTC’s obligation to review a written deliverable within the applicable Acceptance Period
will be contingent on such written deliverable being delivered to OSRTC as scheduled. If and to the
extent any written Deliverable is delivered earlier or later than scheduled, the Acceptance Period for
such written Deliverable shall be extended as reasonably necessary to accommodate the availability
of OSRTC personnel responsible for reviewing such deliverable.
Similarly, if and to the extent multiple written deliverables are delivered to OSRTC within an
Acceptance Period, the Acceptance Period for all such written Deliverables shall be extended as
reasonably necessary to accommodate the availability of OSRTC personnel responsible for
reviewing them.
OSRTC agrees to notify the SI in writing by the end of the acceptance Period either stating that the
applicable written deliverable is accepted / rejected in the form delivered by the SI or describing with
reasonable particularity any deficiencies that must be corrected prior to acceptance of such written
deliverable. If the SI does not receive any such notice from OSRTC by the end of the Acceptance
Period, the SI shall promptly notify OSRTC in writing that no such notice has been received. If the
SI does not receive the required notice within seven (7) days after OSRTC receives such written
notification from the SI, such written Deliverable will be deemed to be accepted by OSRTC
If OSRTC delivers to the SI a timely notice of rejection/deficiencies, the SI will correct the described
deficiencies as quickly as possible and, in any event, within ten (10) days after OSRTC notifies the
SI of the rejection/deficiencies (unless otherwise specified in the agreed Project Plan). Upon receipt
of a corrected written deliverable from the SI, OSRTC will have a period of seven (7) days to review
the corrected written deliverable.

Operational Deliverables

•   To the extent not already specified in the RFP or agreed Project Plan, prior to the date on which
    the SI is scheduled to deliver each Operational Deliverable to OSRTC, both the SI and OSRTC
    will agree upon the testing procedures for the operational Deliverable, including without limitation

                                                                                                          Page 18 of 49

                               RFP Volume-3: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS

     detailed test cases and expected results (the “Acceptance Tests”). The Acceptance Tests will be
     designed to determine whether the Operational Deliverable contains any defects. OSRTC will
     have the opportunity during the Acceptance Period to evaluate and test each Operational
     Deliverable in accordance with the following procedures by executing the Acceptance Tests.
•    When the SI has completed an Operational Deliverable, it will deliver the Operational Deliverable
     at the Installation Site (if not already there), install such Deliverable (if not already installed), and
     perform an installation test reasonably acceptable to OSRTC to verify that the Deliverable has
     been properly delivered and installed. The SI shall notify OSRTC when the Operational
     Deliverable is ‘Ready for Acceptance’, provided that, unless otherwise agreed, such notice shall
     not occur prior to the successful completion by the SI of any installation tests. Such notice will
     start the Acceptance Period, which will be fifteen (15) days or such other period as is stated in
     the RFP or agreed Project Plan. As was the case with written Deliverables, OSRTC’s obligation
     to review any Operational Deliverable within the applicable Acceptance Period will be contingent
     on such Operational Deliverable being delivered to OSRTC as scheduled. If and to the extent
     any Operational Deliverable is delivered earlier or later than scheduled, the Acceptance Period
     for such Operational Deliverable shall be extended as reasonably necessary to accommodate
     the availability of the OSRTC personnel responsible for reviewing such Operational Deliverable.
     Similarly, if and to the extent multiple Operational Deliverables are delivered to OSRTC within
     an Acceptance Period, the Acceptance Period for all Operational Deliverables shall be extended
     as reasonably necessary to accommodate the availability of the OSRTC personnel responsible
     for reviewing them.
•    OSRTC shall notify the SI in writing by the end of the Acceptance Period stating that the
     Operational Deliverable is accepted/rejected in the form delivered by the SI or describing the
     defects. If the SI does not receive any notice of defects from OSRTC by the end of the
     Acceptance Period, the SI shall promptly notify OSRTC in writing that no such notice was
     received. If SI does not receive a notice of defects within 7 days after OSRTC receives such
     written notification from the SI, such Operational Deliverable will be deemed accepted by
     OSRTC.
•    If OSRTC determines during the Acceptance Period that the Operational Deliverable as delivered
     by the SI deviates from its approved specifications or otherwise fails to successfully complete
     applicable Acceptance Tests (or a defect), OSRTC will inform the SI in writing, describing the
     defects in sufficient detail to allow the SI to recreate/rectify them. The SI will correct any defects
     in an Operational Deliverable as quickly as possible after receiving OSRTC’s notice of the
     defects and, in any event, within ten (10) days after receiving such notice (unless otherwise
     specified in the Project Plan/RFP) and provide the corrected Operational Deliverable to OSRTC
     for re-testing within such ten (10) day period.
•    OSRTC will have reasonable additional period after receipt of corrected Operational deliverables
     to re-test it to confirm its proper functioning. The SI will correct any further defects identified by
     OSRTC during the re-test as quickly as possible, but in no event more than ten (10) days after
     OSRTC notifies the SI of the further defects, unless otherwise specified in the agreed Project
     Plan or RFP or agreed by OSRTC.

Correction of Deficiencies in Deliverables:

The SI is unable to correct all deficiencies preventing Acceptance of a deliverable for which it is
responsible after a reasonable number of repeated efforts (but not more than three (3), OSRTC may
at its election:
•    Allow the SI to continue its efforts to make corrections.

                                                                                                                Page 19 of 49

    after the occurrence of such event.
•   The party who has given such notice shall be excused from the performance or punctual
    performance of its obligations under the Contract for so long as the relevant event of Force
    Majeure continues and to the extent that such party’s performance is prevented, hindered, or

                                                                                                              Page 24 of 49

•    The party or parties affected by the event of Force Majeure shall use reasonable efforts to
     mitigate the effect of the event of Force Majeure upon its or their performance of the Contract
     and to fulfill its or their obligations under the Contract, but without prejudice to either party’s right
     to terminate the Contract.
•    No delay or non-performance by either party to this Contract caused by the occurrence of any
     event of Force Majeure shall:

     disaster, fire, sabotage, or other similar occurrence shall not be deemed to be a Force Majeure
     event. For the avoidance of doubt, it is further clarified that any negligence in performance of
     Services which directly causes any breach of security like hacking aren’t the forces of nature and
     hence wouldn’t be qualified under the definition of “Force Majeure”. In so far as applicable to the
     performance of Services, SI will be solely responsible to complete the risk assessment and
     ensure implementation of adequate security hygiene, OSRTC practices, processes, and
     technology to prevent any breach of security and any resulting liability therefrom (wherever
     applicable).

    and Functional Requirement Specifications. Such change shall include, but shall not be limited
    to, changes in the scope of services provided by the SI and changes to the terms of payment as
    stated in the Terms of Payment Schedule.
•   OSRTC and SI recognize that frequent change is an inevitable part of delivering services and
    that a significant element of this change can be accomplished by re-organizing processes and
    responsibilities without a material effect on the cost. The SI will endeavor, wherever reasonably
    practicable, to effect change without an increase in the terms of payment as stated in the Terms
    of Payment Schedule and OSRTC will work with the SI to ensure that all changes are discussed
    and managed in a constructive manner. This Change Control Schedule sets out the provisions
    which will apply to all the changes to this agreement and other documents except for the changes
    in SLAs for which a separate process has been laid out in the SLA Agreement.

Change control note ("CCN")
•   Change requests in respect of the MSA, the Project Implementation, the operation, the SLA, or
    Scope of work and Functional Requirement specifications will emanate from the Parties'
    respective Project Manager who will be responsible for obtaining approval for the change and
    who will act as its sponsor throughout the Change Control Process and will complete Part A of
    the CCN attached as Annexure A hereto. CCNs will be presented to the other Party's Project
    Manager who will acknowledge receipt by signature of the CCN.

                                                                                                       Page 41 of 49

•    The SI and OSRTC, during the Project Implementation Phase and OSRTC during the Operations
     and Management Phase and while preparing the CCN, shall consider the change in the context
     of the following parameter, namely whether the change is beyond the scope of Services including
     ancillary and concomitant services required and as detailed in the RFP and is suggested and
     applicable only after the testing, commissioning and certification of the Pilot Phase and the
     Project Implementation Phase as set out in this Agreement.
•    It is hereby also clarified here that any change of control suggested beyond 15% of the value of
     this Project will be beyond the scope of the change control process and will be considered as
     the subject matter for a separate bid process and a separate contract. It is hereby clarified that
     the 15% of the value of the Project as stated in herein above is calculated based on bid value
     submitted by the SI and accepted by OSRTC or its nominated agencies or as decided and
     approved by OSRTC or its Nominated Agencies. For arriving at the cost / rate for change up to
     15% of the project value, the payment terms and relevant rates as specified in Annexure D shall
     apply.
•    The SLAs defined in this contract are subject to modifications/amendments in view of the annual
     review or to meet any other project requirements. Any such change in SLA will not be considered
     as a change request.

     CCN the SI shall provide as a minimum:
     o    a description of the change.
     o    a list of deliverables required for implementing the change.
     o    a timetable for implementation.
     o    an estimate of any proposed change.
     o    material evidence to prove that the proposed change is not already covered with in the
          agreement and the scope of work.
•    Prior to submission of the completed CCN to OSRTC, the SI will undertake its own internal review
     of the proposal and obtain all necessary i ternal approvals. As a part of this internal review
     process, the SI shall consider the materiality of the proposed change in the context of the MSA,
     and the Project Implementation affected by the change and the total effect that may arise from
     implementation of the change.

Costs
Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs incurred in the quotation, preparation of CCNs and
in the completion of its obligations described in this process provided the SI meets the obligations
as set in the CCN. In the event the SI is unable to meet the obligations as defined in the CCN then
the cost of getting it done by third party will be borne by the SI.

Obligations
The SI shall be obliged to implement any proposed changes once approval in accordance with above
provisions has been given, with effect from the date agreed for implementation and within an agreed
timeframe. SI will not be obligated to work on a change until the parties agree in writing upon its
scope, price and/or schedule impact.

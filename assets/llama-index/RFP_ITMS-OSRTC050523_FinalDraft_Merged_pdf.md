Bidder shall provide an automated tool to monitor and report all the SLAs as mentioned.

Page 103 of 120
---
# RFP Volume-2: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS


A Service Level violation will occur if the Bidder fails to meet Minimum Service Levels, as measured on a Quarterly basis, for a particular Service Level. Overall Availability and Performance Measurements will be monthly for the purpose of Service Level reporting. An “Availability and Performance Report” will be provided by the Bidder on a monthly basis in the OSRTC suggested format and a review shall be conducted based on this report. A monthly Availability and Performance Report shall be provided to the OSRTC at the end of every month containing the summary of all incidents reported and associated Bidder performance measurement for that period.

The SLAs will prevail from the start of the Operations and Maintenance Phase. Payments to the Bidder are linked to the compliance with the SLA metrics laid down in the tables below. The penalties will be computed and calculated as per the computation explained in this Section. During the contract period, it is envisaged that there could be changes to the SLA in terms of addition, alteration, or deletion of certain parameters, based on mutual consent of both the parties i.e., OSRTC and Bidder.

The SLA is not a fixed document to be produced once and used forever. Instead, it must be re-evaluated and updated as the work environment changes. As technology changes, the services and systems covered by the SLA and their performance expectations will change. This document may be reviewed and revised by mutual Agreement between OSRTC and Bidder. Changes to the SLA may be required at other times to include new systems, changes in operating hours, etc.

All changes to the SLA will be initiated in writing between OSRTC and the Bidder. The Service levels here are standard for OSRTC and will be modified when both parties agree to an appended set of terms and conditions.

All measurements and calculations shall be in the metric system and calculations done to 2 (two) decimal places, with the third digit of 5 (five) or above being rounded up and below 5 (five) being rounded down except in money calculations where such amounts shall be rounded off to the nearest Rupee.

The following table outlines the key service level requirements for the system, which need to be ensured by the Bidder during the operations and maintenance period. These requirements shall be strictly imposed and either OSRTC or a third-party audit/certification agency shall be deployed for certifying the performance of the Bidder against the target performance metrics as outlined in the tables below.

# Implementation Service Level

Parameters: The SLA parameters for the implementation stage would be directly related to the delivery timelines of the deliverables as mentioned. This would consist of the entire Bill of Materials and the applications system with successful UAT of the same.

Period: These SLAs would be applicable until GO-LIVE. The deliverables would be measured at every payment milestone as mentioned.

Penalty Value: For delay of every week in completion & submission of the deliverable, the SI would be charged with a penalty as follows:

|Delay (Weeks)|Penalty % on the respective Payment milestone value|
|---|---|
|1|0.15%|
|2|0.20%|
|3|0.25%|

Page 104 of 120
---
# RFP Volume-2: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS


Capping: The upper limit of penalty would be capped at 10% of the respective Payment Milestone value. In case the successful bidder reaches 10% of the respective Payment Milestone value in the form of penalty at any point of time during pre-implementation phase, OSRTC reserves the right to invoke the termination clause.

A delay of every week would also account for an increase of an additional 2 weeks in the maintenance period which will be over and above the maintenance period of 3+2 years. This duration would be accounted without incurring any charges to OSRTC.

# 7.5. Operation Service Level

SLA Management and Monitoring Tool as specified in this RFP shall play a critical role in monitoring the SLA compliance and hence will have to be customized accordingly. The 3rd party testing and audit of the system shall put sufficient emphasis on ensuring the capability of SLA Management and Monitoring Tool to capture SLA compliance correctly and as specified in this RFP. The selected Bidder (SI) must deploy SLA Management and Monitoring tool and provide for capturing the required data for SLA report generation in automated way. This tool should generate the SLA Management and Monitoring report at the end of every month and every quarter which is to be shared with OSRTC. OSRTC will audit the tool and the scripts on a regular basis.

Where required, some of the Service Levels will be assessed through audits or reports e.g., utilization reports, measurements report, etc., as appropriate to be provided by the Bidder on a quarterly basis, in the formats as required by OSRTC.

**Measurement of SLAs**
|Sr. No|Parameter|Measurement of SLAs|
|---|---|---|
|1|Infrastructure Related SLAs|SLA Management and Monitoring Tool|
|2|ITS Application related SLAs|SLA Management and Monitoring Tool|
|3|Client Site (ICT Assets) Availability|SLA Management and Monitoring Tool|

It may be noted that the Bidder must provide the required tools to measure the SLA parameters. OSRTC reserves the right to appoint a Third Party for the audits. Audits will normally be done on a regular basis or as required by OSRTC and will be performed by OSRTC or OSRTC appointed third party agencies. The bidder shall make provision that requisite permission is given to the Third-Party Agency for carrying out the audit process on a regular basis.

# 7.6. Violations and Associated Penalties

The framework for Penalties, because of not meeting the Service Level Agreements Targets is as follows:

- A quarterly performance evaluation will be conducted using the Quarterly reporting periods of that period.
- The performance will be measured for each of the defined service level metric against the minimum/target service level requirements and the violations will be calculated accordingly.
- The number of violations in the reporting period for each level of severity will be totaled and used for the calculation of Penalties.

Page 105 of 120

# RFP Volume-2: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS


# Penalties for Violations

Penalties applicable for each of the high severity (H) violations are one (1) % of respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder.

Penalties applicable for each of the medium severity (M) violations is half percentage (0.5%) of respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder.

Penalties applicable for each of the low severity (L) violations are Quarter percentage (0.25%) of respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder.

Penalties applicable for not meeting a high (H) severity performance target in two consecutive Quarters on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 3% of the respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each such high critical activity.

Penalties applicable for not meeting a medium (M) severity performance target in two consecutive Quarterly periods on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 2% of the respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each such medium critical activity.

Penalties applicable for not meeting a low (L) severity performance target in two consecutive Quarterly periods on same criteria shall result in additional deduction of 1% of the respective Quarterly payment to the Bidder. Penalties shall be applicable separately for each such medium critical activity.

If the overall penalty applicable for any of the review period during the contract exceeds 25% of the quarterly payment or if the overall penalty applicable for any of the successive Quarterly periods during the contract is above 15%; then OSRTC shall have the right to encash the Performance Bank Guarantee or terminate the contract or both.

# RFP Volume-3: Selection of System Integrator (SI) for ITMS


Operational Deliverables, will include the successful completion of agreed acceptance and performance testing and, in the case of the System as a whole, will include meeting the specifications, performance standards and functional requirements set out in the RFP. In the case of Deliverables that are component parts of the System, in addition to acceptance of the component deliverables, the system will also be subject to acceptance in its entirety. SI shall prepare and propose the test procedures, which shall be described in the acceptance criteria for each deliverable and shall be subject to agreement by OSRTC. While designing the acceptance test procedures the requirements as mentioned in volume II of RFP need to be adhered. The Acceptance tests and test procedures shall be sufficiently broad in scope and rigorous to verify that the system and all other deliverables meet all applicable specifications, acceptance criteria and performance requirements, including assurance that the deliverables and the system meet such tests of operational integrity as may be reasonably required by OSRTC. In the case of the system, the acceptance tests shall consist of unit tests, a system test, and/or stress test acceptance procedures for written deliverables (which are all deliverables other than Operational Deliverables) and Operational Deliverables are as follows:

# Written Deliverables

The SI may submit interim drafts of written deliverables (e.g., system designs and documentation) to OSRTC for review. OSRTC agrees to review each interim draft within a reasonable period after receiving it from the SI. When the SI delivers a final written deliverable to OSRTC, OSRTC will have the opportunity to review such written deliverable for an acceptance period of seven (7) days or such other period as is stated in the RFP or the agreed Project Plan (the “Acceptance Period”). In all cases, OSRTC’s obligation to review a written deliverable within the applicable Acceptance Period will be contingent on such written deliverable being delivered to OSRTC as scheduled. If and to the extent any written Deliverable is delivered earlier or later than scheduled, the Acceptance Period for such written Deliverable shall be extended as reasonably necessary to accommodate the availability of OSRTC personnel responsible for reviewing such deliverable.

Similarly, if and to the extent multiple written deliverables are delivered to OSRTC within an Acceptance Period, the Acceptance Period for all such written Deliverables shall be extended as reasonably necessary to accommodate the availability of OSRTC personnel responsible for reviewing them.

OSRTC agrees to notify the SI in writing by the end of the acceptance Period either stating that the applicable written deliverable is accepted / rejected in the form delivered by the SI or describing with reasonable particularity any deficiencies that must be corrected prior to acceptance of such written deliverable. If the SI does not receive any such notice from OSRTC by the end of the Acceptance Period, the SI shall promptly notify OSRTC in writing that no such notice has been received. If the SI does not receive the required notice within seven (7) days after OSRTC receives such written notification from the SI, such written Deliverable will be deemed to be accepted by OSRTC.

If OSRTC delivers to the SI a timely notice of rejection/deficiencies, the SI will correct the described deficiencies as quickly as possible and, in any event, within ten (10) days after OSRTC notifies the SI of the rejection/deficiencies (unless otherwise specified in the agreed Project Plan). Upon receipt of a corrected written deliverable from the SI, OSRTC will have a period of seven (7) days to review the corrected written deliverable.

# Operational Deliverables

To the extent not already specified in the RFP or agreed Project Plan, prior to the date on which the SI is scheduled to deliver each Operational Deliverable to OSRTC, both the SI and OSRTC will agree upon the testing procedures for the operational Deliverable, including without limitation.
